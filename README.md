# Calculator With Tests
A project for writing tests that verify that a Calculator class is functioning properly
1. Clone this repository to your machine
2. Create and checkout a new branch to work on this project
3. There is a class called "Calculator"
4. Give the Calculator class 5 methods, but don't implement them yet (perhaps put throw new NotImplementedException(); as a      placeholder in the method body):
   
   -Add
   -Subtract
   -Multiply
   -Divide
   -Factorial
5. If you haven't yet, make a commit
6. Add unit tests that ensure that the calculator methods behave properly
7. Make a commit after each test is written
8. Run the tests to watch them fail (since the Calculator's methods haven't been written yet)
9. Submit a pull request to merge your changes to the master branch

#Bonus: Implement the methods of the Calculator class so that the tests pass
